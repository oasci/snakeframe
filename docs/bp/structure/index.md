# Project Structure

Organizing a Python project is about more than just where files goâ€”it's about creating a system that is **navigable, extensible, and maintainable** over time. As your project grows, a clear structure becomes essential not only for your own sanity, but also for enabling others to contribute effectively, whether they're teammates, students, or collaborators.

This section explores the **principles and patterns** behind effective project layout. You'll learn how to:

- Construct a scalable package hierarchy
- Choose between or combine layered and feature-based architectures
- Maintain clarity and separation between core logic, interfaces, and support utilities

A strong structure gives your code base a logical backbone. It makes it easier to:

- Isolate concerns between modules
- Test and reuse components independently
- Reduce duplication and accidental complexity
- Onboard new contributors quickly
