# Getting Started

This project is a Cookiecutter template designed to help you kickstart a modern, professional Python project with best practices in place.
Whether you're a beginner looking to learn the ropes of real-world Python development or an advanced user needing a reliable scaffold for your next tool or package, this template has you covered.

## What Youâ€™ll Need

Before starting, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- Python 3.11+
- [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html): to generate a project from this template.
- [Pixi](https://prefix.dev/docs/pixi/): a modern project and environment manager (like conda or poetry, but faster and reproducible).

You can install them like this:

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
curl -sSL https://prefix.dev/install.sh | bash
```

After installing Pixi, restart your terminal or ensure `pixi` is in your PATH.
