# Development

This comprehensive guide provides detailed instructions to help maintainers effectively develop, test, document, build, and release new versions of `{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}`.

## Setting up the Development Environment

`{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}` utilizes [`pixi`](https://pixi.sh/latest/) for managing environments and dependencies, streamlining the setup process. Follow these precise steps to configure your development environment:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Begin by obtaining a local copy of the `{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}` codebase:

    ```bash
    git clone git@{{ cookiecutter.git_host }}.com:{{ cookiecutter.organization }}/{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}.git
    cd {{ cookiecutter.project_name }}
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Install all necessary dependencies by running:

    ```bash
    pixi install
    ```
3.  **Activate the development environment:**
    To enter the isolated virtual environment configured specifically for `{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}` development, execute:

    ```bash
    pixi shell
    ```

You are now fully prepared and equipped to develop `{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}`.

## Code Formatting and Style Guide

Maintaining consistent style and formatting across the codebase is crucial for readability and maintainability.
`{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}` employs automated formatting tools configured to enforce standardized style guidelines.
Execute the following command to apply formatting automatically:

```bash
pixi run format
```

This command sequentially runs `black` for Python formatting, `isort` for managing imports, and `markdownlint-cli2` to enforce markdown formatting standards, ensuring your contributions align with project conventions.

## Documentation

`{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}`'s documentation is built using MkDocs, allowing easy creation and maintenance of high-quality documentation.
To locally preview documentation changes, serve the documentation by running:

```bash
pixi run -e docs serve-docs
```

After execution, open your web browser and visit [`http://127.0.0.1:8000/`](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) to review changes in real-time.

## Testing

Writing and maintaining tests is essential for ensuring code correctness, reliability, and stability.
Execute `{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}`'s tests with:

```bash
pixi run -e dev tests
```

Additionally, you can evaluate test coverage to identify untested areas and improve overall reliability by running:

```bash
pixi run -e dev coverage
```

Review the generated coverage reports to address any gaps in testing.

## Building the Package

Prepare `{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}` for publishing or distribution by building the package.
Execute:

```bash
pixi run build
```

Upon completion, inspect the `dist` directory for the generated distribution files, which are ready for publication.

## Bumping Version

Releasing new versions involves explicitly updating version identifiers.
Always modify the version number consistently in these two critical files:

-   `pyproject.toml`
-   `pixi.toml`

Verify that the updated version numbers match exactly, avoiding discrepancies and potential deployment issues.

## Publishing to PyPI

Once the version number is updated and the package is built, it can be published to PyPI.
Execute:

```bash
pixi run publish
```

For preliminary testing or release candidates, it is highly recommended to publish to TestPyPI first.
Execute:

```bash
pixi run publish-test
```

Publishing to TestPyPI allows you to validate packaging correctness and installation processes without affecting production users.

## Maintenance Best Practices

To maintain high quality and reliability of `{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}`, adhere to the following best practices:

-   Regularly synchronize your local repository with the main branch to incorporate the latest updates:

    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```
-   Frequently review and address open issues and pull requests on GitHub.
-   Clearly document changes in commit messages, issue descriptions, and pull requests.
-   Routinely verify dependencies and update them as necessary to maintain compatibility and security.

Adhering to these guidelines ensures a robust, stable, and continuously improving `{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}` project.

This expanded documentation guide covers the entire workflow comprehensively, providing clarity and precision for effective `{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}` project maintenance.
